1. The content of the "fname_out" variable is a filename ending with ".png". It is supposed to be:

Home(missing)Ozone_2001-01-01_simhour(missing).png

2. "simhour" and "Home" are missing. Assuming "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt" is at the beginning of this script, it should be "plt.savefig(fname_out, bbox_inches="tight", pad_inches=0.0)".
